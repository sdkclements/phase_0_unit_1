2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person*
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The first step to creating a repository on Github is simple, after you have created a Gothub account and have downloaded both Git and Github onto your computer go to "github.com/new". 
This will take you to the page where you set up your new repository. 
First name your repository, make it public if you so choose, click the "Initialize this repository with ReadME"
click "Create Repository.

Congratz - You have Created a repository.

To Clone the Repository, go to you Github application on your computer - Make sure you are logged in.
On the left hand side under the Github column select you username.
You may need to refresh the list ( to do this go to the bottom of you Github applicaiton and clikc the refresh)
Next to CLONE click "Clone to computer" on the right hand side of the repository you created moments ago.

Open Source: Is the idea that instead of only allowing people access to the output of the code - the program itself - You have access to the source code as well. This method "open source" allows you to modify the code yourself and in essence make your own version.

I think the idea of Open Source is an incredibly useful tool. It neither makes me feel nervous or protective (perhaps because I have not written much code!) It doesnt feel like a utopia either, I do not hold to ideals really. Still when implemented in the right places it can really allow people to collaborate and when this is done correctly it ledas to amazing insights and quick progress.

Licenses are important they allow attribution to various groups or individuals in various ways. They allow for us to hold on to the idea that we are leaving something behind in our own name our legacy. MIT licenses seem very useful especially at initial work stages.

This Challenge helped me understand how to work github, open source was already known to me. Not much struggle here.
