Once one understand some basic HTML, adding new parts to the webpage is easy. The differnt sizes of headings is easy to understand. As far was what doesnt make sense to me is how html is interpreted due to small changes. A small change in HTML or the CSS code can totally mess the page up when you only expect it to make a small change. It takes a lot of tweaking to get it right, especically the first time around.
Once i started working the <div> classes it was easier to think about styling and workign with the code.
the best resource i used was w3schools.com
