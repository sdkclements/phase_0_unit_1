Hey everyone in my group,
This is comming late so I apologize.
My name is : Samuel Dominic Kirn Clements
I currently am living in Washington D.C. studying at George Washington University.
Favorite websites: reddit - i wonder how this makes you think of me hahaha, next theatlantic.
I have a weird thinking style but its close to abstract sequential.
my learning style is multimodal, emphasis on visual and aural.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

As I am way behind right now I am having fun catching up. It is a ton of work, but now that I am done with exams I am getting into it all and it is making sense to me. I'm glad that im not the only one struggling with stuff, and it seems like everyone here is a great bunch of people. Im happy to be here.
